         | It is paradoxical, yet true, to say, that the more we know, the 
         | more ignorant we become in the absolute sense, for it is only 
         | through enlightenment that we become conscious of our 
         | limitations. Precisely one of the most gratifying results of  
         | intellectual evolution is the continuous opening up of new and 
         | greater prospects.

        | I've always been interested in programming but never had the confidence
        | to persue it. Instead I secretly worked on tweaking web pages and my customizing

        | I am always looking to expand my scope because I really feel that having 
        | at least a general comprehension of many different languages helps to 
        | see problems in new ways.

      p
        | I've dabbled in Java, messed around with Rust, scanned through C++, and
        | work a lot lately in Node.js and Python 3. I've recently made a conscious
        | decision at this point in my life to persue my passion for code and development
        | with 100% of my focus. It's been a long journey so far and I expect it
        | to be longer yet but that is part of the fun and excitement of the journey.

        | Right now I live in the suburbs of New Jersey and spend a good amount
        | of time with family. I'd love to make my way over to the west coast ,
