         | It is paradoxical, yet true, to say, that the more we know, the 
         | more ignorant we become in the absolute sense, for it is only 
         | through enlightenment that we become conscious of our 
         | limitations. Precisely one of the most gratifying results of  
         | intellectual evolution is the continuous opening up of new and 
         | greater prospects.

        | I've always been interested in programming but never had the confidence
        | to pursue it as a career until now. I've been programming for almost 5 
        | years now and I'm almost entirely self taught. I took a few classes in 
        | college and spent a lot of time tweaking web pages, customizing my 
        | favorite programs, and even scripting my operating system to do all 
        | the magic I wanted. That process of curiosity and self discover, 
        | constantly hacking and breaking things to understand how they worked, 
        | taught me a lot.

      p
        | My introduction to programming was with Object-Oriented styles. 
        | I learned Python and basic Java. I am always looking to expand my 
        | language scope because I really believe that being a polyglot, helps 
        | a programmer to analyze problems in many different ways.

        | I've dabbled in Java, messed around with Rust, scanned through C++, 
        | but I work in Node.js and Python 3. I've recently made a conscious 
        | decision at this point in my life to go after my passion for code and 
        | development with 100% of my focus. It's been a long journey so far 
        | and I expect it to be longer yet but that is part of the fun and 
        | excitement of this journey.

        | Right now I live in the suburbs of New Jersey and spend a good amount 
        | of time with family. I enjoy meditation and try to practice yoga at 
        | least once a week. Mind/body balance is very important to me and a 
        | key part of my personal productivity.
